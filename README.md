# reminder

This Progressive Web App is an experiment allowing users to create reminder notifications for anything that they share through the share sheet. This can include web links like blogs or articles, text notes, or images. It demonstrates using [Notification Triggers](https://web.dev/notification-triggers/) and [Share Target Level 2](https://web.dev/web-share/#sharing-files).

If you [install this app](https://catdad-experiments.github.io/share-edit/) using the "Add to home screen" prompt, it will add an "Reminder" option to your share sheet, allowing you to share anything to it and set a reminder.

When I don't necessarily have time -- or worse, am on a train with no cell service -- yet I still decide to scroll through my news feed or twitter, I inevitably come across something I want to follow up on later when I have time. My go-to is to share it to a notes app where it will live for eternity because I never remember to look at it later. This is where this app comes in. I can still share to it just like any other notes app, but it also allows setting a notification to come up later. When I get the notification, I can read that blog post or send that meme off to a group chat and then delete the note. Plus, who doesn't like experimenting with the very latest capabilities of Progressive Web Apps?
